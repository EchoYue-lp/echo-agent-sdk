# echo-agent TypeScript SDK (source)

This directory contains the source-only TypeScript ACP Client for `echo-agent`.
It uses the official `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` v1 client and starts the Host
executable supplied by the caller. No Host binary, Node runtime, or npm
artifact is bundled.
The source client requires Node.js 20 or newer (the compiler target is
ES2022).

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node --input-type=module -e '
import { EchoAgentClient } from "./dist/index.js";
const sdk = await EchoAgentClient.spawn({
  hostCommand: "/absolute/path/to/echo-agent-sdk-host",
});
const agent = await sdk.createAgent();
const session = await agent.createSession();
console.log(await session.prompt("Reply with one word."));
await sdk.close();
'
```

The same flow is checked in as `examples/quickstart.ts`; `npm test` compiles
it, and the repository language gate runs the emitted example against the
source-built Host.

`EchoAgentClient.invoke` and `family` resolve signature digests from the
canonical checked-in catalog. `AgentHandle`, `SessionHandle` and `RunHandle`
are opaque generation-fenced handles; streams are exposed as `AsyncIterable`.
Use `EchoAgentClient.call` or `SessionHandle.invoke` with a canonical operation
identity to let the catalog select the source or family route; process-scoped
operations may be called without a handle.
Lossless scalar constructors (`wireU64`, `wireI64`, `wireBytes`,
`wireUtf8Path`, `wireDuration`, `wireTimestamp`) are exported from the same
wire module and reject non-canonical or out-of-range values.
Language-local helpers are exported from the SDK root as well: `splitUtf8Chunks`
and `IncrementalUtf8Decoder` preserve UTF-8 byte boundaries across streamed
reads, while `cleanJson` and `extractJsonFromMarkdown` match the Rust JSON
parsing utilities for trailing commas and fenced markdown output.
`ToolCallParams` preserves the Rust parameter accessors and required-type
validation. `ToolResult` is available as a factory value (`success`,
`successJson`, `failure`, `invalidArguments`) with immutable `with*` modifiers;
its structured data is encoded through the same lossless WireValue helpers.
Failure categories are closed and preserve Rust recovery (`restore_then_retry`
for unavailable, `verify_then_retry` for timeout/partial side effects,
`retry` for transient and `stop` otherwise); ordinary JSON objects are always
encoded as maps even when they contain `kind`/`value` keys.
The A2A `TaskState` union and `taskStateCanTransitionTo` helper preserve the
closed terminal and transition table without adding a wire route.
`A2AMessage`, `A2ATaskStatus`, `AgentProvider` and `AgentSkill` provide the
same immutable text/status/provider/skill value constructors.
`AgentCard.builder(...)` provides the immutable card value and fluent local
builder; it does not synthesize a card from a Host-owned Agent.
`A2AArtifact.new(...)` and `A2AError.new(...)` preserve the corresponding
wire fields without adding a network route.
`TaskStatusUpdateEvent`, `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` and `A2AStreamResponse`
preserve the typed stream event union locally.
`A2ATaskParams`, `A2ATaskRequest`, `A2ATask`, and `A2ATaskResponse` preserve
the nested task envelope values without executing a task.
`ThinkingLevel` and `thinkingLevelParse(...)` preserve Rust reasoning aliases.
`AgentSteerState` and `AgentSteerTurnOutcome` preserve accepted/drained/settled
values without owning the active Agent turn.
`SubagentCommandPhase` and `SubagentStatus` preserve stable lowercase parsing
without exposing dispatch or receipt ownership.
`ContentGuardResult` preserves pass/detect/reject/redact payloads without
owning guard execution.
`GuardDecision` preserves pass/block/warn/transform outcomes and their payloads.
`DeliveryOutcome` and `DeliveryPhase` preserve stable snake-case ledger values.
`SubagentStopStatus` preserves stable hook terminal values without owning hooks.
`TaskTerminalStatus` preserves stable task terminal values without owning tasks.
`RuleSource` preserves permission source priority values and accepted aliases.
`RuleBehavior` preserves allow/deny/ask payloads and `toDecision` conversion.
`PermissionMode` preserves mode aliases and write/interaction/classifier helpers.
`RuleMatcher` preserves tool/pattern/permission/all matching semantics.
`CommandCellPhase` preserves stable phases and terminal classification.
Command-cell terminal causes and artifact statuses preserve stable values too.
`TeamStrategy` preserves manager/pipeline/debate/swarm values and descriptions.
`ConnectionMode`, `ExtensionSettlement`, and `AcpLedgerLimits` preserve ACP
runtime values without owning the connection or event ledger.
`AcpAdapterConfig` and its validation helper preserve the adapter limits and
lossless shutdown duration without constructing an ACP adapter.
`ExtensionLeaseError` preserves the typed lease failure display text without
owning admission or concurrency decisions.
`JwtConfig` and `JwtClaims` preserve local A2A auth configuration and subject
projection; JWT verification remains Host-owned.
`DependencyKind` and `SkillSource` preserve dependency/source values without
probing or loading skills.
`ContextInheritance` preserves sync/fresh/fork/teammate/team defaults without
owning Subagent context or dispatch.
`ObservedIsolation` preserves trim, empty-default, and Unicode-safe bounds
without owning isolation execution.
`SegmentRange` preserves half-open saturating `len()` and `isEmpty()` values
without owning cache state.
`PromptDiagnostics` preserves section recording and per-id counts without
owning prompt compilation.
`SubagentCommandIdentity` and `SubagentAttemptIdentity` preserve durable ID
validation and projection without owning live control.
`LlmUsageStats` preserves cumulative token counters and payload projection
without owning provider execution.
`ToolOutputArtifactConfig` preserves retention, threshold, and max-age builders
without owning artifact writing.
`SkillValidationReport` preserves violation gating without running validation.
`SkillContent` preserves structured prompt-block rendering without loading or
executing resources.
JSON-RPC request and notification values preserve MCP `2.0` constructors
without owning transport.
`HookAction` preserves tagged configuration and validation without executing
hooks.
`HookEvent` and `HookEventCategory` preserve stable names, `ALL` ordering,
category classification, parsing and matcher predicates without owning hooks.
`EventId`, `StreamId` and `EventIdentity` preserve non-empty validation,
run/chat constructors, correlation fields and immutable `with*` updates.
`InterventionResult` exposes immutable allow/block/cancel/inject/argument
modification factories without owning callback execution.
`TokenBudget`, `TokenBudgetConfig`, `TokenAllocation` and `LlmTimeouts` expose
the same allocation, compression and zero-disabled timeout policy helpers.
`executionUsageDurationMillis` maps absent duration to zero without owning run
accounting.
`TurnMode` preserves the chat/execute stream flavor without owning the turn
driver.
`RetryPolicy` preserves default/no-retry factories, exponential backoff caps
and optional jitter configuration without running retries.
`ThinkingConfig` preserves disabled/level/budget variants, parsing and
provider effort/budget projections without owning LLM transport.
`nowSecs`, `nowMillis`, `nowLocal`, `toLocal` and RFC3339 helpers preserve
local-offset formatting and instant round-trips without persisted clock state.
`ThinkingProtocol` preserves provider dialect names and field-emission
semantics without owning provider transport.
`ResourceLimits` preserves default, strict and unrestricted sandbox policy
snapshots without creating sandbox processes.
`ProviderCapabilities` preserves OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic and Ollama
defaults plus provider-name resolution without owning provider transport.
`ThinkingProfile` and `resolveThinkingProfile` preserve model/provider protocol
selection and manual control levels without contacting a provider.
`ModelProfile`, `ModelProfileOverride`, and `ModelProfileResolver` preserve
provider capability defaults, model limits, tokenizer selection, and provider
then exact override precedence without owning provider transport.
`PageInfo` preserves truncation, continuation metadata, and output projection
without owning collection state.
`SubagentContext` preserves empty/content semantics without owning context or
dispatch state.
`Usage` preserves provider-normalized cache priority and effective token
calculations without owning LLM execution.
`HookAction` preserves tagged configuration and validation without executing
hooks.
`LlmUsageStats` preserves cumulative token counters and payload projection
without owning provider execution.
`SubagentCommandIdentity` and `SubagentAttemptIdentity` preserve durable ID
validation and projection without owning live control.
`SessionHandle.updates()` and `RunHandle.events` are bounded async iterables;
Run events validate stream identity and sequence, acknowledge consumed cursors,
surface gaps, and fail with `host_exited` if the Host exits unexpectedly.
Settled `RunHandle` instances also expose `status()`, `outcomeStatus()`, and
`usage()`. The usage counters (`duration_ms`, `tokens_used`, and `iterations`)
remain textual `WireU64` values, preserving integers that exceed JavaScript's
safe number range.
`EchoAgentClient.classifyTurnOutcome(eventWire)` delegates terminal-event
classification to the Rust authority and returns its explicit Variant or Null
wire value without reimplementing outcome rules in TypeScript.

Typed `ToolDescriptor`, `LlmClientDescriptor`, `StoreDescriptor` and
`CriticDescriptor` descriptors are accepted by `registerTool`,
`registerLlmClient`, `registerStore` and `registerCritic`;
`registerContextCompressor` accepts a named compressor descriptor. Its call
includes a temporary tokenizer reference; `EchoAgentClient.countTokens`
executes the exact Host tokenizer for arbitrary callback text.
Handlers receive the Host-issued `ExtensionInvokeCall` with its operation,
extension handle, invocation identity, deadline and optional stream handle.
Typed results must use the matching operation discriminator; streaming calls
return a Host-minted stream outcome. These helpers only adapt the existing
`_echo_agent/extension/*` contract and do not create a second execution path.
Critic handlers receive the Host-issued `critic_critique` call (`task`, `answer`, and
`context`) and return the structured `Critique` result (`score`, `passed`,
`feedback`, and `suggestions`). Verifier policy, retries, and run settlement
remain Host-owned.
Context-compressor handlers receive the typed message set, lossless token limit,
optional focus fields and return the retained/evicted messages plus an optional
checkpoint. Cancellation, timeout and Session teardown use the same Host-owned
extension invocation authority.
`registerAgentComponent` exposes the closed component/operation contract for
Host-consumed conversation/run/runtime state, audit, context projection,
memory trigger, guard, search, workflow/checkpoint, revisioned task, sandbox,
MCP transport, embedder and memory-promoter implementations. Calls/results use
operation-discriminated unions with per-variant runtime validation rather than
a raw payload. The Host validates the nested discriminators and remains the
Agent lifecycle authority. Conversation ensure/search, Run append/parent-list,
IntentClassifier, SkillLoadPolicy, cancel-aware sandbox execution and
Workflow/Sandbox stream variants are explicit union members. Streaming
callbacks return the Host stream handle and use `agentComponentChunk` /
`agentComponentComplete`; separate chunk and terminal unions prevent invalid
inner terminal sequencing.
