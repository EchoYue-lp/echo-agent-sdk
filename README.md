# echo-agent-sdk

Source-first TypeScript, Python, and Java SDKs for the Rust `echo-agent`
framework, connected through a source-built ACP Host and the
`_echo_agent/*` extension contract.

## Migration Status

The SDK-owned import and extraction history includes the original clean pin
`27c7701e1eb116db1076da7f84bb68898544a44c`. The current Host governance candidate
resolves published framework revision
`00782b8aeddefe2ea8c566922cbdee6aedc80d70` from
[framework PR #186](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent/pull/186).
It includes the framework Git branch-switch repair; this SDK lock also selects
rustls 0.23.46. Signed source/tree, framework post-main CI and the SDK
[published-pin dependency/build checks](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent-sdk/blob/0ebe15f66d0aa57c7b7a92ae68cd1be106114ae9/docs/sdk/governance/evidence/sdk-published-00782-pin/README.md)
have actual reviewed receipts. [Rust14](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent-sdk/blob/0ebe15f66d0aa57c7b7a92ae68cd1be106114ae9/docs/sdk/governance/evidence/sdk-00782-final-rust-gates/README.md)
and the [fourth complete language run](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent-sdk/blob/0ebe15f66d0aa57c7b7a92ae68cd1be106114ae9/docs/sdk/governance/evidence/sdk-language-ci-repairs-final/README.md)
passed locally with all 800 execution inputs recoverable in Git. Its Oracle
JDK21 result does not replace Linux CI Temurin17; new fixture/action revisions
still require actual remote CI and current-source semantic/main acceptance.
The earlier be5 [published-pin provenance](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent-sdk/blob/0ebe15f66d0aa57c7b7a92ae68cd1be106114ae9/docs/sdk/governance/evidence/sdk-chart-published-pin/published-pin-provenance.json)
remains historical. The protocol remains framework-free, and full Rust
inventory remains telemetry. The [historical a634 Rust gates](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent-sdk/blob/0ebe15f66d0aa57c7b7a92ae68cd1be106114ae9/docs/sdk/governance/evidence/sdk-a634-rust-gates/README.md)
and [complete language gate](https://github.com/EchoYue-lp/echo-agent-sdk/blob/0ebe15f66d0aa57c7b7a92ae68cd1be106114ae9/docs/sdk/governance/evidence/sdk-language-a634-reviewed-final/README.md)
bind their exact execution inputs; later runtime repairs require their own
verification and do not inherit those earlier passes.

The [twelve accepted-source continuity choices](docs/sdk/governance/accepted-source-continuity-proposal.md)
are still proposed; complete contract generation and SDK main acceptance remain
pending. Published dependency and passing bounded runtime checks do not by
themselves establish final compatibility or release. This source repository
does not publish a bundled Host or runtime.
See [MIGRATION-SOURCE.md](MIGRATION-SOURCE.md) and
[ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-sdk-repository-boundary.md) for the source boundary,
history, provenance, and ownership decision.
