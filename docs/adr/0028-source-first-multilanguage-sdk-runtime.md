# ADR 0028: Source-First Multilanguage SDK Host on ACP

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-04
- Owners: `echo-agent` framework
- Design: [`../supreme/specs/2026-09-04-source-first-multilanguage-sdk-runtime/design.md`](../supreme/specs/2026-09-04-source-first-multilanguage-sdk-runtime/design.md)

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

`echo-agent` is a reusable Rust Agent framework. TypeScript, Python, and Java
developers need idiomatic access to the complete behavior exposed by the root
`echo_agent` facade, while editors and other interactive clients also need a
standard way to invoke an echo-agent coding Agent.

The framework already owns versioned `EventEnvelope` values, finite turn
driving, exactly-one-terminal receipts, revisioned Task execution, cancellation,
recovery, Tool, LlmClient, Store, HumanLoopProvider, Subagent, MCP, A2A,
workflow, memory, and feature contracts. A transport adapter must project these
authorities rather than create another execution model.

[ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/overview) standardizes the
bidirectional relationship between an interactive Client and a coding Agent.
Stable protocol v1 covers initialization, Session setup, Prompt Turns, updates,
cancellation, permission, filesystem, terminal, plan, mode, and related
capability negotiation. ACP also defines a compatible extension mechanism:
custom data belongs in `_meta`, custom methods begin with `_`, and support is
advertised during initialization.

ACP does not define the complete public API of an Agent framework. In
particular, it does not provide lossless contracts for arbitrary Agent builders,
Run handles and replay, TaskRun/PlanTask/Subagent control, consumer-defined
LlmClient or Store implementations, framework journals, workflow builders, or
all echo-agent features.

## Industry Basis

- The [official ACP protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/overview)
  uses bidirectional JSON-RPC and models coding Agents as Client-launched
  subprocesses.
- [ACP extensibility](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/v1/extensibility)
  provides namespaced custom capabilities and underscore-prefixed methods
  without changing standard fields.
- The [official ACP Rust SDK](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/rust-sdk)
  provides schema, Agent, Client, Proxy, connection, and conformance machinery;
  TypeScript, Python, and Java libraries are also available.
- [OpenAI Codex SDK](https://developers.openai.com/codex/sdk/) wraps one local
  Agent engine and consumes structured subprocess events.
- [Claude Agent SDK](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) exposes
  idiomatic language APIs while retaining one Agent loop authority.

## Options Considered

### 1. Private SDK protocol plus a separate ACP adapter

Maintain one complete echo-agent JSON-RPC protocol for the SDK and another ACP
endpoint for editors. Both could call a shared service, but session, prompt,
update, cancellation, framing, capability, and conformance logic would remain
duplicated at the transport boundary.

### 2. Stable ACP v1 plus namespaced echo-agent extensions

Use official ACP as the only base Client-Agent protocol. Standard ACP clients
consume the standard profile. TypeScript, Python, and Java echo-agent SDKs use
the same connection and negotiate `_echo_agent/*` methods for facade behavior
that ACP cannot express losslessly.

### 3. Standard ACP only

Expose only ACP v1 and remove the private SDK protocol. This gives broad editor
interop but cannot meet the confirmed requirement for complete semantic parity
with the root Rust facade.

### 4. Native FFI or independent language implementations

N-API, PyO3, and JNI retain one Rust core but require three native async and
callback boundaries. Reimplementing the framework in every language creates
four authorities for execution, state, cancellation, and recovery.

## Decision

1. Choose option 2. Stable ACP v1 is the only base protocol between the SDK
   Host and all Clients.
2. Add a product-neutral, optional `acp` feature to the root `echo_agent`
   facade. It uses the official stable ACP Rust SDK and exposes a generic ACP
   Agent adapter.
3. Add a source-built process named `echo-agent-sdk-host`. The Host implements
   the ACP Agent role. The name denotes a Rust framework host, not a bundled
   Node.js, Python, or Java runtime.
4. TypeScript, Python, and Java SDKs implement the ACP Client role and prefer
   composition of the official language ACP libraries. They do not fork the ACP
   schema or reimplement standard Session/Prompt messages.
5. The first scope does not implement a generic echo-agent ACP Client, Proxy,
   Conductor, draft protocol v2, or unstable ACP features. Those are separate
   future capabilities.
6. Standard ACP clients use standard initialize, Session, Prompt Turn, update,
   cancellation, permission, filesystem, terminal, plan, mode, and command
   behavior without requiring echo-agent extensions.
   The Host launch configuration supplies one product-neutral default Agent
   definition for this profile; `session/new` fails explicitly when none exists.
7. Full SDK clients negotiate an `echo-agent` capability in ACP `_meta` and use
   `_echo_agent/*` requests and notifications for the rest of the root facade.
8. Standard ACP fields and methods are never extended in place. Echo-agent data
   that is not part of ACP uses namespaced `_meta` or namespaced extension
   methods only.
9. ACP request IDs follow the official ACP schema. Stable Agent, Session, Run,
   Event, operation, extension, generation, and idempotency identities are
   separate non-empty string fields in domain payloads.
10. One internal Session/Run service serves both profiles. ACP Session and
    Prompt Turn map to the same framework objects used by SDK handles.
11. Standard `session/update`, plan entries, tool-call status, and stop reason
    are compatibility projections of framework facts. They never become the
    TaskRun, Subagent, event, or terminal authority.
12. Complete `EventEnvelope`, Run snapshots, cursor replay, event gaps, Task and
    Subagent state, and extension receipts remain available through
    `_echo_agent/*` without being flattened into ACP fields.
13. Consumer-defined Tool, LlmClient, Store, HumanLoopProvider, Hook/Callback,
    AgentFactory, and other facade traits use the namespaced bidirectional
    extension bridge with typed identity, generation, timeout, cancellation,
    bounded concurrency, and deterministic disconnect behavior.
14. ACP permission, filesystem, terminal, and elicitation calls are made only
    when the Client negotiated the corresponding capability. Missing capability
    does not fall back to hidden local execution.
15. Keep MCP and A2A as their existing external protocols. ACP connects an
    interactive Client to a coding Agent; MCP connects Agent to tools/resources;
    A2A connects Agent to Agent.
16. Deliver ACP adapter, Host, extension protocol, TypeScript SDK, Python SDK,
    and Java SDK as source in the `echo-agent` repository. Do not publish or
    download project-built binaries, npm packages, wheels, or JARs.
17. Define SDK parity as complete functional and semantic equivalence with
    idiomatic language APIs, not Rust ABI, ownership, generic, lifetime, or
    macro parity.
18. The parity authority is every documented public item reachable from the
    root `echo_agent` facade across all public features, including the new
    `acp` feature. Internal workspace crate items remain outside that promise.
19. Maintain a machine-checked parity manifest that classifies each public item
    as ACP standard, ACP standard projection, echo-agent extension, or language
    intrinsic, and maps it to all three SDKs.
20. Reuse `EventEnvelope`, `AgentTurnDriver`, `RuntimeTaskService`, and existing
    framework services. Neither ACP nor SDK adapters own duplicate Agent, Run,
    Task, Subagent, retry, cancellation, or recovery semantics.

## Framework And Application Boundary

The generic ACP schema dependency, Agent adapter, standard-to-framework
projection, echo-agent extension contract, and conformance tests belong in
`echo-agent`. They are complete without EKO and are useful to any framework
consumer.

EKO process discovery, external Agent selection, workspace mapping, GUI/TUI
rendering, product persistence, and product permission policy belong in
`echo-agent-cli`. EKO may consume the framework ACP adapter but must not parse
ACP independently or create a second Session/Run authority.

## Implemented Adapter Contract

The first framework increment implements a transport-neutral stable v1 Agent
adapter behind the root `acp` feature. It composes the official
`agent-client-protocol` builder and typed messages rather than implementing a
JSON-RPC parser. Each `session/new` invokes an `AcpSessionFactory` and stores a
distinct framework Agent; the registry stores only protocol addressing and the
active turn cancellation token. Conversation history remains inside the Agent.

The root feature depends only on the published official ACP runtime. The
source-only, non-published `echo-sdk-protocol` workspace crate remains the
extension contract authority for the later Host and language SDKs; making it a
root optional dependency would prevent the framework feature from remaining an
independently consumable Cargo package before extension handlers exist.

`session/prompt` leaves the official serial dispatch loop before awaiting the
Agent. The spawned connection task uses `AgentTurnDriver`, an `EventSink`
projection and `TurnReceipt`; this keeps `session/cancel` and
`$/cancel_request` dispatchable while a turn is running. Both routes converge
on the same framework token, and turn identity guards prevent late cleanup from
clearing a later turn.

Text-only prompts keep the broadly compatible text Agent path. ACP ResourceLink
prompts enter the structured Message path as provider-neutral `LinkedResource`
parts, so framework Agents can inspect every field and plain user text cannot
impersonate resource metadata. Providers without a native linked-resource block
render a deterministic text fallback only at their own wire boundary.

This increment advertises only the stable initialize/new/prompt/update/cancel
baseline. `_meta.echo_agent`, optional Session methods and language SDKs remain
unavailable until their delivery outcomes make the corresponding handlers real.

## Implemented Standard Host Contract

The second framework increment adds the non-published `echo-sdk-host` workspace
crate and source-built `echo-agent-sdk-host` executable. It requires an explicit
`--config` path, accepts at most 1 MiB of versioned JSON, validates the default
Agent and constructs the model client before ACP stdio begins. Configuration
discovery, EKO profiles, `.env` loading and bundled language runtimes are not
part of the Host.

One stateless model client is shared, while every `session/new` creates a fresh
`ReactAgent` carrying that ACP Session's identity and cwd. The Host factory
accepts only ACP stdio MCP declarations with unique names and absolute UTF-8
commands. Each process starts in the ACP Session cwd, and all declared servers
must connect before the Session response. Partial setup closes the Agent.
Remote MCP, additional directories, memory and human-loop settings fail
explicitly because this standard profile does not yet advertise their required
semantics.

The Host delegates framing and process EOF to the official `Stdio` transport
and delegates all ACP handlers, cancellation, projection and bounded shutdown
to `AcpAgentAdapter`. Subprocess conformance tests launch the real binary with
the official Client and a loopback streaming model endpoint. Therefore the
supported standard profile is ACP conformant, while `_echo_agent/*`, language
SDK execution, Runnable and parity-complete status remain unclaimed.

## Consequences

- Any standard ACP Client can invoke the supported echo-agent coding Agent
  profile without an echo-agent-specific SDK.
- The three SDKs reuse ACP transport and standard interaction types while
  retaining full facade parity through explicit extensions.
- ACP conformance and echo-agent SDK parity are independent quality gates. One
  cannot be inferred from the other.
- Standard ACP projections may be less expressive than framework state. Their
  limitations stay visible and do not weaken the full SDK contract.
- ACP absolute UTF-8 paths cannot represent every platform path. Standard ACP
  methods fail explicitly when needed; echo-agent extensions retain a lossless
  path representation.
- The project must track stable ACP compatibility separately from official ACP
  crate/schema artifact versions and echo-agent extension versions.
- Developers install Rust and their language toolchain and compile all outputs
  from one Git revision.
- Node.js/browser environments that cannot spawn a local process remain out of
  scope.
- Every root facade change carries ACP relationship, TypeScript, Python, Java,
  docs, examples, Schema, parity-manifest, and verification impact.

## Rejected Fallbacks

- ACP failure must not fall back to a private base protocol, language
  reimplementation, A2A shortcut, or EKO path.
- A standard ACP Client that did not negotiate `_echo_agent/*` must never
  receive or be required to understand SDK extension messages.
- Missing Host features return typed capability errors; SDKs do not simulate
  them.
- Extension failure remains visible to the originating framework operation;
  the Host does not substitute an unrelated built-in implementation.

## Verification Contract

- Run official stable ACP v1 conformance against the framework Agent adapter and
  source-built Host.
- Verify a non-echo-agent standard ACP Client can initialize, create/load a
  Session when supported, prompt, observe updates, cancel, and receive a stop
  reason.
- Machine-check the root facade public inventory against the parity manifest,
  including the ACP relationship classification.
- Decode the same echo-agent extension values and errors in Rust, TypeScript,
  Python, and Java.
- Run all three SDKs against a real locally built ACP Agent Host and verify the
  complete extension profile.
- Cover permission/filesystem/terminal capability absence, standard-only
  Clients, extension-version mismatch, failure, cancellation, timeout,
  disconnect, event gap, slow consumers, Host termination, restart, and late
  callback responses.
- Compile and execute ACP and language quickstarts from a clean source checkout
  without project-published or downloaded prebuilt artifacts.

## Post-decision record: core profile runtime decisions (supreme plan 05)

When the negotiated `_echo_agent/*` core profile was implemented, the
following runtime and recovery decisions were made and verified with
real-process E2E (`echo-sdk-host/tests/core_profile_e2e.rs`):

- **One shared connection runtime.** The root adapter owns a single
  protocol-neutral `AcpConnectionServices` (Session registry, Run authority,
  ledger-first event path). Standard `session/prompt` and extension
  `run/start` both enter `start_run`, so a Session has exactly one active
  run slot and both entries share run ids, cancellation tokens and
  terminals. Extension handlers merge onto the official dispatch loop via
  `Builder::with_connection_builder`; nothing is parsed twice.
- **Ledger-first events.** Every accepted `EventEnvelope` is committed to a
  bounded per-run ledger (durable journal hook first) before the standard
  projection and the `_echo_agent/event` view are produced. Journal or
  projection failure fails the run — a run never reports success over an
  unverified journal.
- **ACK-bounded live delivery.** Because the official outgoing queue is
  unbounded, backpressure is enforced by the ACK window: at
  `max_outstanding_live_events` the Host sends one gap notification and
  pauses live delivery; Clients recover through bounded `run/replay` plus
  `_echo_agent/event/ack`. Host memory stays bounded regardless of consumer
  speed.
- **Generation-fenced recovery.** Every Host start advances a persisted
  generation under the explicit state root. Pre-restart handles answer
  `stale_handle`; `session/load` mints fresh-generation handles and reports
  history from the run index; runs active at crash time recover as
  `interrupted` with no terminal or receipt, and `run/wait` answers typed
  `host_exited`. Interrupted drivers are never revived; new runs continue
  from the framework checkpoint only.
- **Executable typed contract.** Core DTOs implement the official typed
  JSON-RPC traits (derive-based) instead of the raw `_`-fallback, one fixed
  server-error code (`-32050`) carries the bounded `EchoSdkError` in
  `error.data`, and the Host embeds only the small generated
  `source-contract.json` digest — never the large inventory artifacts.


## Decision: bidirectional extension bridge (plan 06)

The bridge ships as one connection-scoped authority plus thin per-trait
proxies; both live behind the Host's `sdk-extension-bridge` feature and the
negotiated `extension_bridge` capability.

- **One invocation authority, no second run authority.**
  `echo_agent::acp::ExtensionInvocationAuthority` owns only callback
  lifecycle: admission, bounded concurrency permits, per-invocation
  cancellation, exclusive-mutation leases and exactly-once settlement. Run
  terminals, receipts, retries and event sequences stay with the framework.
- **Typed per-kind descriptors over free-form values.** Registrations carry
  a versioned `ExtensionDescriptor` bound to the `ExtensionKind`; the
  closed `ExtensionOperation` set rejects kind/operation mismatches before
  any callback leaves the process. `InterventionCallback` is its own kind —
  never an observational-callback alias.
- **Official transport only.** Reverse calls ride
  `ConnectionTo::send_request` inside spawned tasks with caller-side
  deadlines; cancellation sends the official `$/cancel_request` plus the
  typed `_echo_agent/extension/cancel` notice. Disconnects map to typed
  `extension_disconnected`; late answers are discarded, never applied.
- **Host-minted stream identity.** Streaming invocations mint the stream
  handle Host-side; the SDK echoes it and delivers monotonic chunks with
  exactly one terminal. The Rust stream ends exactly at the terminal and
  releases the handle.
- **No implicit fallback.** A failed, timed-out, cancelled or disconnected
  callback returns typed errors; the Rust API's own retry/cancel policy
  decides what happens next.
- **Connection-owned registrations.** Registrations never survive a Host
  restart or reconnect, are idempotent per identity + descriptor
  fingerprint (different descriptor → typed `extension_conflict`), and are
  released after Session Agents close in the teardown order.
- **Framework additions kept minimal.** The bridge needed exactly two
  generic framework primitives that did not exist: a programmatic hook
  source (`HookRegistry::set_programmatic_hook`, mirroring the existing
  type-erased executor injections) and exporting the `HumanInLoop` tool for
  embedders that swap the approval provider. Everything else uses existing
  public setters.

## Decision: facade feature adapters (plan 07)

The facade adapter layer ships as the `sdk-facade-adapters` Host feature
(plus the explicit `sdk-facade-all` profile) behind the negotiated
`feature_surfaces`/`task_graph`/`subagents`/`structured_output`
capabilities.

- **One executable catalog, no path heuristics.** The generated
  `contracts/sdk/facade-operation-catalog.json` is embedded verbatim and is
  the only route authority: exact operation identities, per-route sha256
  signature digests and frozen all-of/any-of feature requirements. Unknown
  operations, wrong digests and unlisted family operations fail closed with
  typed errors; the generic invoke surface never wildcards.
- **Feature authority stays with Cargo.** The `initialize` advertisement is
  derived from the compiled feature set (`echo-sdk-host/src/features.rs`);
  `sdk-facade-adapters` implies `framework-subagent` so `task_graph` is
  never advertised without the task execute/control handlers. `improve`
  explicitly implies `eval`, matching ImprovementLoop's public type
  dependencies; the Host passthrough preserves that transitive feature.
  `sdk-extension-bridge` explicitly implies `sdk-facade-adapters`, because the
  compressor bridge's Host tokenizer is invoked through the canonical facade
  route instead of a duplicate bridge-only dispatcher.
  Family methods and invoke routes enforce the same feature semantics.
- **Family handlers are thin adapters.** Task/PlanTask bind the Session's
  `TaskRevisionService`/`RuntimeTaskService`; subagent verbs bind the same
  `SubagentExecutor`; stateful/integration/tool families call the framework
  services directly. The Host owns addressing and lifecycle only.
- **Host-issued handles and hard bounds.** TaskRun/PlanTask handles are
  minted and generation-fenced by the Host; a second `task/execute` of a
  live run is a typed conflict; live subagent records obey the advertised
  `max_open_handles`; family resources obey the advertised
  `max_facade_resources`; page and argument bounds come from the same
  advertised limits.
- **Teardown is bounded and complete.** Session close cancels the session's
  task executions and subagent dispatches and drops its family resources;
  connection teardown cancels all live executions/dispatches and awaits
  `McpManager::close_all` inside the bounded shutdown chain.
- **Honest status.** The Rust Host facade adapters and source-built
  TypeScript/Python/Java client route baselines are delivered; executable
  route mappings are complete, while process-local intrinsic items remain
  explicitly `not_implemented` until their language-native behavior and
  evidence are delivered. `channels` is bound when both the framework channel
  feature and the typed extension bridge are compiled; `telemetry` has its
  process-scoped adapter, while `testing` remains deliberately unbound with
  method-not-found, never simulated results.

## Decision: ThinkingLevel source-only value slice

The multilingual SDKs expose the Rust `ThinkingLevel` wire values as
language-native enums or frozen values, with the Rust case-insensitive aliases
(`none`/`off`, `minimal`/`min`, `medium`/`med`/`normal`, and the remaining
levels) preserved by each parser. This slice is deliberately source-only:
developers compile the TypeScript, Python, and Java code themselves, and no
JDK, Python runtime, Node runtime, or binary artifact is bundled. The parity
manifest records the nine canonical identities and their language-specific
behavior tests; Rust remains the sole semantic authority.

## Decision: facade public-API parity (plan 08)

- **No generic source fallback.** Every canonical `source:` operation is
  mechanically exercised against the real Host and must reach a concrete
  adapter. Agent, Session, Run, Task, Subagent, Store, MCP and Skill operations
  reuse their existing authorities. Durable filesystem functions call
  `echo_core::utils::fs`; lease and identity-guard values live behind the
  unified Session-owned `FacadeResource` handle.
- **Intrinsic membership is frozen, not inferred.** Pure language values and
  Rust-only construction helpers carry an explicit reason. Rust closure APIs
  such as `atomic_compare_and_swap` remain process-local because narrowing an
  arbitrary predicate to byte equality would not be semantically equivalent.
  A digest over every canonical intrinsic item fails when a new member appears
  beneath a previously classified type or module.
- **Consumer traits form a closed set.** Live host-language implementations use
  typed ExtensionBridge kinds. Rust generic, borrowed-view, `FnOnce`,
  marker/builder, event-bus registration and runtime-owned construction traits
  without a Host call site carry an exact process-local evidence route and a
  language interface/helper obligation. Canonical consumer traits cannot fall
  into generic invocation or be relabeled as a same-topic family/core route.
- **Stateful public methods stay in Rust.** EvalRunner/LlmGrader,
  ImprovementLoop/TrajectorySaver, PluginRegistry and concrete memory backends
  are Session-owned facade resources. Their complete state/I/O method sets use
  exact source operations or `memory.resource.*` Store verbs; they are not
  hidden by process-local intrinsic labels.
- **Callback inputs are semantically complete.** Agent-component calls and
  results are operation-discriminated DTO unions. ContextCompressor callbacks
  receive a temporary Host-owned tokenizer resource, and same-Session
  callback mutations fail immediately with `extension_conflict`.
- **Default trait methods remain overridable.** ConversationStore ensure/search,
  RunStore append/parent-list, Sandbox cancel-aware execution and
  Workflow/Sandbox streams have explicit component operations. IntentClassifier
  and SkillLoadPolicy are live components; the latter is awaited by discovery,
  prepared registration and reconciliation. Workflow mutation is exclusive per
  registration; ordinary Send+Sync component calls remain concurrent across
  Sessions. Sandbox and Workflow use separate typed chunk/terminal DTOs, and
  extension Workflow events reuse the graph stream projection.
- **Eval dependencies remain caller-selected.** Eval/grade calls use explicit
  Agent handles, batch/improvement calls invoke an AgentFactory lazily, and
  RunStore accepts either the Host trace resource or a language component.
  Public eval/improvement configuration fields are exposed as resource
  property operations.
- **MCP publication is transactional and bounded.** Client/tool handle
  publication rolls back and disconnects as one transaction. Transport
  initialization failure and post-initialize facade-handle publication failure
  both close the transport; notification polling is on-demand and capacity
  bounded.
- **Public streams are real streams.** Agent streams use Run/EventReplay and
  extension streams use ExtensionBridge. Workflow and A2A producers use a
  capacity-one pull queue with `next/cancel/close`; the returned Stream handle
  is minted, owner-checked, sequenced and tombstoned by the existing
  `HandleRegistry`. The runtime map stores only receivers and producer tasks,
  never a second stream identity or lifecycle state.
- **Status remains layered.** Rust Host facade parity and executable language
  route mapping are complete, but overall `Parity complete` remains closed
  until every intrinsic mapping has a real language-native implementation and
  behavior evidence in all three SDKs.

Plan 08 final validation passed the complete workspace, all-feature,
single-feature, contract, source-language and real Host ExtensionBridge gates.
The resulting change is intentionally folded into the facade parity, Java,
Python, TypeScript and shared SDK commits; no binary, runtime or registry
artifact is published.
