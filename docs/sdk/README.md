# echo-agent SDK (standard ACP Host available)

This is the single external entry point for the echo-agent multilingual SDK
program. The SDK's goal is full **functional and semantic parity** between
the Rust framework's public facade and TypeScript, Python and Java — without
rewriting the agent framework in any of those languages.

> **Current status: ACP conformant (standard profile) + core extension profile
> + extension bridge + facade feature adapters delivered in the Rust Host.** The source-built `echo-agent-sdk-host` passes
> initialize/new/prompt/update/cancel and shutdown scenarios through the
> official v1 Client, and the negotiated `_echo_agent/*` **core profile**
> (Agent/Session/Run handles, full events, ACK/replay, restart recovery) passes
> real-process E2E ([sdk-core-profile.md](sdk-core-profile.md)), the negotiated
> bidirectional **extension bridge** passes real-process E2E for Tool,
> LlmClient, Store, hooks and callbacks
> ([sdk-extension-bridge.md](sdk-extension-bridge.md)), and the **facade
> feature adapters** serve the task/subagent/structured-output, stateful,
> integration and tool families over the framework's own authorities
> ([facade-feature-adapters.md](facade-feature-adapters.md)). Plan 08 closes
> the Rust Host's canonical source-operation, consumer-trait and public-stream
> routing, including real Workflow/A2A pull streams. Source-built TypeScript,
> Python and Java clients now resolve every canonical source and family
> operation through the shared catalog and preserve all WireValue shapes. The
> executable route baseline passes against one source-built Host; process-local
> intrinsic mappings remain explicit follow-up work. See [Status
> ladder](#status-ladder) for the exact claims.

## What the SDK program is

- **Source-first delivery.** The repository ships source only. Developers
  compile everything (Host, SDK, tests) from the same Git revision. No
  precompiled binaries, npm packages, wheels or JARs are published, and the
  build never downloads prebuilt project artifacts.
- **ACP-first wire.** The stable [Agent Client Protocol
  v1](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/overview) is the only base
  client↔agent protocol. This project never forks or re-declares the
  official JSON-RPC envelope, `initialize`, Session, Prompt, ContentBlock,
  updates or stop reasons — they come from the official
  [`agent-client-protocol`](https://crates.io/crates/agent-client-protocol)
  ecosystem artifacts pinned in
  [`contracts/sdk/acp-baseline.json`](../../contracts/sdk/acp-baseline.json).
- **Two profiles, one authority.** A standard ACP v1 client can use the
  Host's standard profile without knowing anything about echo-agent. The
  full echo-agent SDK profile negotiates `_echo_agent/*` extension methods
  (via the official `_meta` capability mechanism) to cover the complete
  public facade losslessly. Both profiles project the same Rust execution
  and state authority — the wire never becomes a second framework.

Details of the two profiles, the extension namespace and the error/lossless
scalar rules live in [protocol.md](protocol.md). The delivered core profile —
negotiation, handles, events/ACK/replay and recovery semantics — is specified
in [sdk-core-profile.md](sdk-core-profile.md). The delivered facade family
routes, feature model, resource/stream lifecycle and error boundaries are
specified in [facade-feature-adapters.md](facade-feature-adapters.md).

The implemented Rust adapter and its current method/content boundary are
documented in [acp-agent-adapter.md](acp-agent-adapter.md).
Build, configuration and lifecycle instructions for the executable are in
[acp-standard-host.md](acp-standard-host.md).

Source SDK clients live under [`sdks/`](../../sdks/):

- [`sdks/typescript`](../../sdks/typescript) uses the official ACP TypeScript client;
- [`sdks/python`](../../sdks/python) uses the official ACP asyncio client;
- [`sdks/java`](../../sdks/java) provides the Java 17 CompletionStage/Flow client.

Each directory is source-only and requires the caller to provide an absolute
Host executable and configuration path.
Runtime compatibility is recorded in [`sdks/shared/toolchain.json`](../../sdks/shared/toolchain.json):
Node.js 20+, Python 3.10+, and JDK 17. The SDKs never install or bundle these
runtimes.

The cross-language source gate is `./scripts/check-language-sdks.sh`. It builds
the Host from the current checkout, validates every executable language mapping
in the parity manifest, checks all catalog operation identities and signatures,
compiles and runs the TypeScript/Python quickstarts plus Java example, runs the
TypeScript/Python/Java suites, and exercises Agent/Session, canonical family
operations and facade invoke against that real Host. Intrinsic mappings remain
explicit until their language-native behavior is delivered.

## Contract artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `contracts/sdk/acp-baseline.json` | Pinned official ACP wire version (1), crate and schema artifact versions; tests assert the lockfile matches. |
| `contracts/sdk/toolchain.json` | The exact nightly toolchain used for rustdoc-JSON inventory generation. Contributors only; normal builds never need it. |
| `contracts/sdk/public-api.txt` | Deterministic root-facade snapshot with expanded workspace re-exports, members, fields, variants and API-shape digests. |
| `contracts/sdk/parity-manifest.schema.json` | Machine schema for facade identities, signatures, feature availability, adapter obligations and language mappings. |
| `contracts/sdk/parity-manifest.json` | Every facade item classified by an explicit semantic rule, ACP relationship, feature condition, adapter operation and per-language mapping/test status. Entries use one JSON line each so diffs remain reviewable. |
| `contracts/sdk/schema/echo-agent-extension-v1.schema.json` | Generated JSON Schema of the `_echo_agent/*` extension DTOs and method catalog. |
| `contracts/sdk/fixtures/extension/v1/` | Golden fixtures: valid samples must round-trip losslessly, invalid samples must be rejected deterministically. |
| `contracts/sdk/source-contract.json` | Small generated source-compatibility digest (Cargo.lock + facade inventory + parity manifest) embedded by the Host and matched by the Client hello. |

The generating code lives in the workspace member crate
[`echo-sdk-protocol`](../../echo-sdk-protocol/) (`publish = false`). All
artifacts are machine-generated; regeneration is deterministic and
byte-stable:

```bash
# regenerate after an intentional facade or contract change
cargo run -p echo-sdk-protocol --bin export_schema --locked -- --update

# read-only drift check (also run by scripts/verify.sh and CI)
./scripts/check-sdk-contracts.sh
```

## Status ladder

The SDK program distinguishes the following statuses; each implies the
previous ones.

| Status | Meaning | Reached |
|---|---|---|
| **Design** | The design document is agreed | ✅ |
| **Contract** | Protocol contracts, schema, parity manifest exist and pass drift gates | ✅ |
| **ACP conformant** | A standard ACP v1 client passes the supported profile against a real source-built Host | ✅ |
| **Core extension profile** | The negotiated `_echo_agent/*` core families run against a real Host with typed lifecycle, events, replay and recovery | ✅ (Rust Host only) |
| **Host facade parity** | Every canonical root operation/consumer trait/stream has a concrete Host route or evidence-backed language-local boundary | ✅ Plan 08 complete |
| **Runnable** | A real Host plus at least one language's full SDK extension path executes end-to-end | ❌ intrinsic facade mappings remain |
| **Parity complete** | TypeScript, Python and Java all pass the full facade/all-features parity suite | ❌ intrinsic mappings and behavior matrix pending |
| **Published** | Registry/binary publication — **explicitly out of scope**; this design ships source only | never (by design) |

Only *Parity complete* justifies claiming "all public Rust capabilities are
available from the SDK". Executable routes currently use the canonical
resolver and serializable values use the lossless WireValue algebra; the
manifest keeps process-local mechanisms `not_implemented` until their
language-native behavior is implemented and tested. The first intrinsic value
slice (`ToolCallParams` and `ToolResult`) is now implemented and tested in all
three languages; the remaining intrinsic route set is still open.
The closed A2A `TaskState` transition/display slice is also implemented in all
three languages, without changing the wire surface.
The related A2A Message, TaskStatus, Provider and Skill value constructors are
covered by the same native-only intrinsic boundary.
The Agent Card and fluent local builder are also available in all three
languages; `from_agent` remains open because it requires the Rust Agent
authority.
The immutable A2A Artifact and Error DTOs preserve their wire fields in all
three languages as well.
The A2A status/artifact stream event and JSON-RPC response DTOs are also
available as local immutable values; stream transport remains Host-owned.
Task request/params/response and task history envelopes are available as
immutable nested DTOs; execution remains a Host operation.
The local `ThinkingLevel` enum and parser preserve Rust reasoning-effort names
and aliases in all three language SDKs.
Steering lifecycle state and terminal outcome values are also available as
local immutable values; receipt and turn ownership remain Host-side.
Subagent command phases and terminal statuses are available as local values;
the Subagent dispatch and message receipt remain Host-owned.
Content-guard pass/detect/reject/redact decisions are available as local
immutable values; guard execution remains Host/Rust-owned.
Rust `GuardResult` is exposed as the language-native `GuardDecision` value;
Python's existing component `GuardResult` remains unchanged.
Delivery outcomes and phases are available as local values; the durable ledger
and delivery lifecycle remain framework-owned.
Subagent hook stop statuses are also local values; hook execution and dispatch
remain framework-owned.
Task terminal statuses are local values; PlanTask execution and task lifecycle
remain framework-owned.
Permission rule source values are local projections; rule evaluation and
priority authority remain in Rust/Host.
Permission rule behaviors are also local projections with decision conversion;
evaluation and RuleRegistry authority remain in Rust/Host.
Permission modes expose their canonical IDs, aliases, and policy predicates;
mode evaluation remains framework-owned.
Permission rule matchers expose pure parse/display/matching helpers; registry
and evaluation authority remain in Rust/Host.
Command-cell phases are local values; command process/sandbox execution remains
framework-owned.
Command-cell terminal causes and artifact statuses are local values; process
and artifact writer ownership remains framework-owned.
Team strategy values are local projections; Team dispatch and coordination remain
framework-owned.
ACP connection mode, extension settlement, and bounded ledger-limit values are
also available as native local projections; ACP connection/session and ledger
ownership remain Host/Rust-owned.
`AcpAdapterConfig` is available as a validated local configuration snapshot;
constructing or running the ACP adapter remains a Host/Rust responsibility.
Typed ACP lease errors preserve the Rust display text while lease admission and
concurrency decisions remain Host/Rust-owned.
A2A `JwtConfig` and `JwtClaims` are available as local immutable projections;
JWT verification, key handling, and A2A server ownership remain Host/Rust-owned.
Skill dependency kinds and skill sources are also local values; probing,
loading, and source policy remain framework/Host-owned.
Subagent context inheritance defaults are available as immutable local values;
message history, tools, memory stores, and dispatch remain framework-owned.
Observed isolation names preserve trim/default and Unicode-safe 512-scalar
bounds; isolation provider execution remains framework-owned.
Segment ranges preserve Rust's half-open, saturating length semantics without
owning the message cache.
Prompt diagnostics preserve section recording and per-id counts without owning
prompt compilation.
Subagent command/attempt identities preserve validation and attempt projection
without owning live-control registry state.
Cumulative Subagent LLM usage values preserve sticky reporting, token
accumulation, and payload projection without owning provider execution.
Tool output artifact configuration preserves retention, threshold, and max-age
defaults without owning artifact writing.
Skill validation reports preserve violation gating without running Skill
validation or loading authority.
Skill content values preserve structured prompt-block rendering without loading
or executing resources.
MCP JSON-RPC request and notification values preserve the `2.0` constructors
without owning MCP transport.
Hook action values preserve tagged configuration and validation without
executing commands, HTTP, MCP, or Subagent actions.
Hook event names and categories preserve the Rust matcher classification,
stable `ALL` ordering, PascalCase parsing, and tool/matcher predicates without
owning hook dispatch.
Event and stream identity values preserve non-empty validation, UUID-backed
run/chat constructors, optional correlation fields, and immutable updates;
the Host still owns stream sequencing and lifecycle.
Intervention result factories preserve allow/block/cancel/inject/argument
modification decisions as local immutable values; callback execution stays
with the Host.
Token budget and LLM timeout policies preserve allocation percentages,
compression thresholds, report projections, and zero-disables-timeout behavior
as local configuration values.
Execution usage duration helpers preserve Rust's absent-to-zero projection
without owning run accounting.
Turn mode values preserve the chat/execute stream flavor without owning the
turn driver.
Retry policy values preserve no-retry/default construction, exponential
backoff caps and optional jitter configuration without executing retries.
Thinking configuration values preserve disabled/level/budget variants,
flexible parsing and provider effort/budget projections without owning LLM
transport.
Time helpers preserve Unix timestamps, local-offset RFC3339 serialization,
UTC round-trips and null option values without owning persisted clock state.
Thinking protocol values preserve provider dialect names and field-emission
semantics without owning provider transport.
Sandbox resource limit values preserve default, strict and unrestricted policy
snapshots without creating sandbox processes or owning execution lifecycle.
Provider capability values preserve OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic and Ollama
defaults plus provider-name resolution without owning provider transport.
Thinking profile values preserve model/provider protocol selection and manual
control levels without contacting an LLM provider.
Model profile values preserve provider capability defaults, model limits,
tokenizer selection, and provider/exact override precedence without owning
provider transport.
LLM API protocol values preserve endpoint path selection, strict complete-path
detection, and Anthropic fallback semantics without opening HTTP connections.
Model input modality values preserve text-only and historical all-supported
ordering without owning model transport.
Response format values preserve text, JSON object, and strict JSON Schema tags
without validating or executing provider responses.
Page metadata values preserve truncation, continuation metadata, and output
projection without owning collection state.
Subagent context snapshots preserve empty/content semantics without owning
tools, messages, stores, or dispatch.
Provider-normalized Usage values preserve cache priority and effective token
calculations without owning LLM execution.
Hook action values preserve tagged configuration and validation without
executing commands, HTTP, MCP, or Subagent actions.
Cumulative Subagent LLM usage values preserve sticky reporting, token
accumulation, and payload projection without owning provider execution.
Subagent command/attempt identities preserve validation and attempt projection
without owning live-control registry state.

## For contributors

- The inventory toolchain is pinned in
  [`toolchain.json`](../../contracts/sdk/toolchain.json); install it with
  `rustup toolchain install <toolchain>` if you intend to regenerate
  contracts. Nothing in a normal build installs it for you.
- Any new public facade item or signature change appears in the inventory;
  the parity manifest check then **blocks CI** until its semantic mapping and
  generated artifacts are reviewed. Cross-crate glob re-exports are expanded
  from matching workspace rustdoc documents instead of stored as `::*`
  placeholders. Public registry re-exports use the exact locked dependency's
  rustdoc JSON; procedural and declarative macros carry behavior-source
  digests so helper/body changes cannot bypass drift detection.
- Extension versioning, digest and compatibility rules: see
  [protocol.md](protocol.md#versioning-and-compatibility).
