# SDK protocol contract

This document describes the wire-level contract of the echo-agent SDK: the
two profiles, the extension namespace, lossless scalar rules, error taxonomy,
event/replay semantics and versioning. The stable initialize/new/prompt/update/
cancel subset now has a transport-neutral Rust Agent adapter and a real
source-built stdio Host; the core extension profile and the extension bridge are delivered in
that Host (see [sdk-core-profile.md](sdk-core-profile.md) and
[sdk-extension-bridge.md](sdk-extension-bridge.md)). Source-built TypeScript,
Python and Java clients now pass the executable route baseline against that
Host; the first intrinsic value slice is also implemented in all three SDKs,
while the remaining intrinsic facade mappings remain follow-up work (see the [status
ladder](README.md#status-ladder)).

## Base protocol: official ACP v1

The SDK builds on the stable [ACP v1](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/v1/extensibility)
wire protocol. Everything standard is owned by the official artifacts pinned
in [`contracts/sdk/acp-baseline.json`](../../contracts/sdk/acp-baseline.json):

| Layer | Version (pinned) |
|---|---|
| ACP wire `protocolVersion` | `1` (latest stable; draft v2 explicitly excluded) |
| `agent-client-protocol` crate | `2.1.0` |
| `agent-client-protocol-schema` crate | `=1.7.0` |

The three layers are governed independently: none of them may be inferred
from another (design §18). Tests assert both the lockfile match and that the
official crate's `ProtocolVersion::LATEST` is still `V1` — upstream
promoting the draft would fail the gate loudly.

This repository **never** re-declares JSON-RPC envelopes, `initialize`,
Session, Prompt, ContentBlock, update or stop-reason types. The generated
extension schema is validated to contain none of them.

## Implemented standard Agent adapter

The root `acp` feature exposes `echo_agent::acp::AcpAgentAdapter`. It implements
the official Rust SDK's Agent-side `ConnectTo<Client>` boundary and can attach
to any official transport. Its handlers currently implement stable v1
`initialize`, `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/update` and
`session/cancel`; the official runtime also supplies request-level
`$/cancel_request` dispatch.

Each `session/new` calls an `AcpSessionFactory` with the exact cwd, additional
directories, MCP declarations, request metadata and initialized Client
capabilities. The returned framework Agent exclusively owns that Session's
conversation history. The adapter then drives every Prompt through
`AgentTurnDriver` and turns accepted `EventEnvelope` values into bounded ACP
message/thought/tool updates. Both cancellation routes cancel the same
framework token. `TurnReceipt` separately records execution and event
delivery; only `Completed + Delivered` becomes a successful final stop reason,
while delivery failure is a bounded protocol error that does not rewrite the
execution terminal.

The adapter also owns the negotiation surface: a composable extension profile
publishes `agentCapabilities._meta.echo_agent`, validates the Client hello
under `clientCapabilities._meta.echo_agent`, and merges its typed handlers
onto the same official dispatch loop via `Builder::with_connection_builder`.
Standard and extension entries share one connection runtime (one Session
map, one Run authority, one ledger-first event path), so a standard Prompt
and an extension Run observe the same run ids and the single active-run slot.

Text and ResourceLink are accepted; ResourceLink maps to the provider-neutral
structured `LinkedResource` content part with every ACP field preserved.
Text-only Agents fail a ResourceLink Prompt explicitly rather than receiving
an ambiguous private text marker. Other content types fail before Agent
execution. See [acp-agent-adapter.md](acp-agent-adapter.md) for construction
and limitations.

## Source-built standard Host

The non-published `echo-sdk-host` crate builds the `echo-agent-sdk-host`
executable. It loads only the path supplied by `--config`, validates the
bounded schema-v1 document and model client before opening stdio, constructs a
new `ReactAgent` for each Session, and connects the adapter to the official
stdio transport (a bounded newline-frame byte limiter feeds the official
runtime when the core profile is enabled). It does not parse JSON-RPC or own
another Session, Turn, event, cancellation, or terminal state machine.
With `sdk_profile` configured (and the `sdk-core-profile` feature built in),
the same process additionally serves the negotiated core profile over the
same connection — see [sdk-core-profile.md](sdk-core-profile.md).

While serving ACP, stdout contains protocol frames only. Diagnostics use
stderr and are bounded. Closing stdin closes the official transport and enters
the adapter's bounded Session cleanup. ACP `session/new` MCP declarations are
accepted only for stdio servers with absolute UTF-8 command paths, and each MCP
process starts in that Session's cwd; remote MCP and additional directories are
rejected before Session creation. See
[acp-standard-host.md](acp-standard-host.md) for the exact config and commands.

## Two profiles

| | Standard ACP profile | echo-agent SDK core profile |
|---|---|---|
| Consumer | any ACP v1 client | echo-agent SDK (TS/Python/Java, executable routes) |
| Methods | standard ACP only | standard + negotiated `_echo_agent/*` core families |
| Event view | ACP `session/update` (bounded projection) | full `EventEnvelope` extension stream + ACK/replay |
| Negotiation | plain `initialize` | `initialize` + `_meta` hello/advertisement match |
| Delivered | ✅ Rust Host | ✅ core families (Rust Host); source SDK client baselines ✅; full language parity ❌ |

A standard client ignores the `_meta` capability and keeps working. An SDK
client **fails closed** when the extension protocol version, contract/source
digest, required capability or feature set does not match — the Host stays
Standard and extension calls answer method-not-found; it never silently
degrades to partial parity (design §10.2).

## Extension namespace

All custom methods live under `_echo_agent/*` (leading underscore per ACP
extensibility) and every family is declared in the capability object
published under `initialize._meta.echo_agent`. The frozen catalog (method
name, direction, capability, request, result and error schema) is embedded in
the generated
[`echo-agent-extension-v1.schema.json`](../../contracts/sdk/schema/echo-agent-extension-v1.schema.json)
and enforced by `echo_sdk_protocol::catalog`:

- `_echo_agent/agent/*` — construction, description, close **(delivered)**
- `_echo_agent/session/*` — extension session handles and recovery load **(delivered)**
- `_echo_agent/run/*` — start/get/wait/cancel/steer **(delivered)**
- `_echo_agent/run/replay` + `_echo_agent/event` + `_echo_agent/event/ack` +
  `_echo_agent/gap` — lossless event stream, ACK-bounded live delivery,
  durable replay, retention gaps **(delivered)**
- `_echo_agent/task/*` — TaskRun/PlanTask graph operations
- `_echo_agent/subagent/*` — dispatch/await/control
- `_echo_agent/extension/*` — host-language extension registration and reverse
  invocation (Host → SDK); when an SDK callback returns a stream handle, its
  independently identified chunk/terminal events flow SDK → Host
- `_echo_agent/facade/invoke` and `_echo_agent/memory|workflow|state/op` —
  manifest-identified operations using the closed tagged `WireValue` algebra

The catalog contains **no** standard ACP method and nothing outside the
namespace; both are machine-checked.

The parity manifest does not infer ACP projection from words such as
`prompt` or `session`. Only explicitly listed ACP-owned value families receive
`standard_projection`; builders, trait implementations and process-local Rust
fields are language-intrinsic, while long-lived resources use handles. APIs
visible only under feature combinations record an `all_of` condition rather
than an unexplained `full` marker.

## Identity and handles

JSON-RPC request ids follow the official ACP schema and are never domain
identity. Framework objects cross the wire as
[`WireHandle`](../../echo-sdk-protocol/src/handle.rs): a non-empty domain id,
a generation counter and a typed kind (agent, session, run, stream, task_run,
plan_task, subagent, extension). A handle whose generation no longer matches
resolves to a typed `stale_handle`/`closed_handle` error — never a silent
rebind.

## Lossless scalars

Standard ACP paths are absolute UTF-8 strings and standard numbers must
survive every client runtime. The extension profile therefore carries the
facts ACP cannot (design §10.5):

- `WireI64` / `WireU64` — canonical decimal strings with no JSON precision loss
- `WireDuration` — full-range unsigned seconds plus sub-second nanoseconds
- `WireTimestamp` — signed Unix seconds plus sub-second nanoseconds, including
  times before the epoch (RFC 3339 display is optional)
- `WirePath` — Unix bytes (base64) / Windows UTF-16 units / exact UTF-8
- `WireBytes` — base64 binary
- `WireValue` — a closed tagged algebra for scalar, collection, record,
  variant, handle and unknown additive values; method contracts have no
  schema-free JSON payload escape hatch

All are covered by golden fixtures with mandatory lossless round-trips.
Native path and binary fields declare `echo-*` JSON Schema formats. The
contract validator registers those formats with the same canonical no-pad
base64 and absolute-path functions used by Rust runtime validation, preventing
language generators from accepting a relative encoded path that the Host
would later reject.

## Error contract

Standard methods return standard ACP/JSON-RPC errors. `_echo_agent/*`
methods use the typed envelope in
[`error.rs`](../../echo-sdk-protocol/src/error.rs): stable `code`
(closed set), message, `retryable` classification, optional operation and
handle identity, and bounded details (no raw payloads, no secrets). Codes
cover capability/version/digest mismatch, invalid input, feature
unavailability, stale/closed handles, framework errors, extension bridge
failures (rejected/failed/timeout/disconnected), cancellation, host
shutdown/exit, event gap/replay unavailability and payload/serialization
bound violations.

## Events, replay and gaps

The framework `EventEnvelope` is the event authority; the extension
notification carries every identity fact (schema version, event id, content
hash, sequence from 1, parent link, timestamp) plus the real framework
`AgentEvent` tag/data payload, bound to a current-generation stream handle.
Contract tests convert an actual framework event envelope to the wire DTO and
back.

Live delivery is ACK-bounded: the Host keeps at most
`max_outstanding_live_events` un-acknowledged notifications per stream, and
at the bound it sends one `_echo_agent/gap` notification and pauses live
delivery until the Client ACKs a cursor (`_echo_agent/event/ack`) after
recovering through `run/replay`. Replay is cursor-based (stream handle,
`after_sequence`, bounded `max_events`/bytes), journal/envelope sequence
alignment is validated, and falling below the retention floor produces a
typed `event_gap` with a snapshot watermark — events are incremental facts,
never a substitute for a snapshot (design §11.2). A run has exactly one
authoritative terminal; EOF or process exit is never success, and a run that
was active across a Host crash is recovered as `interrupted` without
terminal or receipt (`run/wait` answers typed `host_exited`).

## Versioning and compatibility

- Git revision is the source-delivery compatibility boundary.
- The extension protocol version (currently `1`), the contract digest
  (sha256 over the canonical schema document), the source-contract digest
  (sha256 over Cargo.lock + facade inventory + parity manifest, delivered as
  the small generated `contracts/sdk/source-contract.json` that the Host
  embeds) and the official ACP artifact versions move independently.
- Additive wire fields are forward-compatible; unknown values surface as
  `WireValue::Unknown` without crashing older SDKs.
- Removing fields, changing defaults or terminal/cancel semantics, or
  reusing an error code is a breaking change: in this development-phase
  repository such a change updates Host, SDKs, fixtures, manifest and docs
  in the same commit — no legacy fallback is kept.


## Extension bridge methods

The bridge family lives under `_echo_agent/extension/*` and is advertised
as the `extension_bridge` capability only when the Host compiles the
`sdk-extension-bridge` feature. See [sdk-extension-bridge.md](sdk-extension-bridge.md)
for registration, invocation, stream, cancellation and error semantics, and
the generated schema for the authoritative wire shapes.
`ContextCompressor` is a typed reverse bridge kind: the Host sends messages,
lossless token limit, optional focus fields and a temporary tokenizer resource.
The SDK can count arbitrary text with the exact Host tokenizer while the
callback is active, then returns retained and evicted messages plus an optional
checkpoint through the same invocation settlement authority.

`AgentComponentCallInputWire` / `AgentComponentCallResultWire` are closed,
operation-discriminated unions. Each ConversationStore, RunStore,
RuntimeStateStore, AuditLogger, ContextProjector and MemoryTrigger operation
freezes its named input/result fields; the schema does not hide the complete
payload behind an untyped JSON value.

`WorkflowCheckpointStore` also freezes the complete claim settlement contract:
`save_if_generation`, `claim`, `renew_claim`, `ack_claim` and `requeue_claim`
carry canonical generation and attempt identities. Its descriptor must declare
`claim_heartbeat_interval_ms` from 1 through 300000; the Host uses that value
for the active resume heartbeat instead of guessing the remote store's lease.
All three language SDKs validate the same operations, result shapes and bound.

| Method | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `_echo_agent/extension/register` | Client → Host | Register a host-language implementation (typed per-kind descriptor). |
| `_echo_agent/extension/unregister` | Client → Host | Idempotent release of a registration. |
| `_echo_agent/extension/invoke` | Host → Client | Reverse invocation of one extension operation. |
| `_echo_agent/extension/cancel` | Host → Client | Cancellation/deadline notice for an in-flight invocation. |
| `_echo_agent/extension/stream` | Client → Host | Stream chunk or the single terminal of a streaming callback. |

## Facade feature families

The facade families live under `_echo_agent/<family>/op` plus the typed
`_echo_agent/task/*`, `_echo_agent/subagent/*` and
`_echo_agent/structured_output/validate` methods, and the generic
`_echo_agent/facade/invoke` surface for exact source identities. The
embedded `facade-operation-catalog.json` is the route authority; family
operations, signature digests, feature requirements, resource bounds and
teardown semantics are specified in
[facade-feature-adapters.md](facade-feature-adapters.md).

The generic source-operation route is mechanically closed: each canonical
identity reaches a concrete Host adapter, or the manifest classifies it as an
evidence-backed language-local construct. Stateful filesystem leases and
identity guards are Session-owned `FacadeResource` handles; live skill-registry
operations address the Session Agent's registry.
`facade.resource.close` explicitly releases any owner-matched facade resource;
repeat close is idempotent and foreign owners fail closed.

Workflow and A2A family streams use pull operations on their existing family
method. `workflow.graph.run_stream` / `a2a.task.stream.open` return a
Host-issued `WireHandle(Stream)`. `workflow.stream.*` and `a2a.stream.*`
provide `next`, `cancel` and `close`. Each successful `next` advances the
registry-owned sequence exactly once and yields a typed
`echo_sdk::FacadeStreamEvent` (`item`, `complete`, `failed` or `cancelled`). The producer queue has
capacity one; owner, generation, cancellation and idempotent close use the same
`HandleRegistry` as Run and extension streams. Concurrent `next` calls are
serialized per stream so dequeue and sequence advancement cannot race.
